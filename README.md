# Data Science Portfolio of Projects

This is a repository containing data science projects completed by me for freelance, consulting and academic purposes. The projects are presented in iPython Notebooks and R markdown files (published at RPubs).

## Contents

- ### Artificial Intelligence (Deep Learning)
  
  - [MPPA]
    - [Code](https://google.ca)
  _Tools: Python, CNTK, Numpy, Matplotlib_

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb){:target="_blank"}: A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
	- [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/finding_donors/finding_donors.ipynb): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
	- [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
	- [Reinforcement Learning: Training a Smartcab to Drive](https://github.com/sajal2692/Training-a-Smartcab-to-Drive): Creating an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal.
	- [Deep Learning: Digit Sequence Recognition using CNNs](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/digit_recognition-mnist-sequence.ipynb):  Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize sequences of digits using synthetic data generated by concatenating images from MNIST.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_ 

- ### Natural Language Processing

	- [3-way Sentiment Analysis for Tweets](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/3-Way%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20for%20Tweets.ipynb): 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine.

	- [Cross language Information Retrieval](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Cross%20Language%20Information%20Retrieval.ipynb): Cross language information retrieval system (CLIR) which, given a query in German, searches text documents written in English.

	_Tools: NLTK, scikit_
